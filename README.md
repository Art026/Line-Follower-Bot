**WORKING:**

We connect two sensors to the front of the bot, which are used the detect obstacles. 

When the two sensors encounter white surface, our bot moves forward.

If the left sensor detects a black surface i.e, the tape or the path we created, it is understood that the path turns left there and hence we program our wheels in such a way that the bot turns left.

Similarly, if the right sensor detects the path tape, the bot is programmed to turn right.

If both the sensors detect a black surface, the bot stops indicating the end of the path.
